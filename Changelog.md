# Changelog

## 1.5.2
* Fix error when calling `/health` route:
    - There was a typo in `__init__` method of _LivenessProbeListener_ throwing an exception.

## 1.5.1
* Fix exception when trying to close _LivenessProbeListener_:
    - Add `is_running` attribute.

## 1.5.0
* Add partial graceful shutdown support:
    - The application waits for all the current requests to be responded and all the events in the aggregator's channels be handled;
    - If the application receives events upon initiating shutdown, they may be lost.
* Configure `/ready` and `/health` to have different behaviours:
    - `/health` returns `OK` and 200 if the application is running. Else, it responds `NOT OK` and 503;
    - `/ready` returns `OK` if `/health` returns `OK` and if the application can connect with the database. Else, it responds `NOT OK` and 503.
* Add a way to deprecate events and not handle them when receive:
    - `MCONF_WEBHOOK_DEPRECATED_EVENTS` is a new env variable that tells which events the aggregator should not handle when receive them. The value must have each event separated by spaces, `meeting-ended meeting-created user-joined` for example.
